      <h3>Description</h3>
      This recipe is taken from the Kingdom Hearts series of games, which 
      are based on the characters of the Disney universe. It is a simple
      but delicious treat to prepare. It is the perfect combination of 
      both sweet and salty. The popsicles should be prepared well in 
      advance of when it will be served, as it needs time in the 
      freezer to set. The quantity of salt is not specified as it is 
      subjective to taste. Experiment with different batches to find 
      the perfect balance.
