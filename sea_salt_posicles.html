      <h3>Description</h3>
      This recipe is taken from the Kingdom Hearts series of games, which 
      are based on the characters of the Disney universe. It is a simple
      but delicious treat to prepare. It is the perfect combination of 
      both sweet and salty. The popsicles should be prepared well in 
      advance of when it will be served, as it needs time in the 
      freezer to set. The quantity of salt is not specified as it is 
      subjective to taste. Experiment with different batches to find 
      the perfect balance.

      <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>In a saucepan, over medium-high heat, combine the heavy cream, 
          milk and honey.</li>
        <li>Once combined remove the saucepan from the heat and add the 
            vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture in a bowl and slowly add the sea salt. Taste 
            until you are happy with the level of saltiness. It is easy 
            to overdo it so be careful.</li>

            match the game likeness or to try new colours.</li>
        <li>Place in the refrigerator and allow it to chill for 2 hours.</li>
        <li> After it has cooled, place the cream mixture in the molds and 
            allow to chill in the freezer overnight.</li>
