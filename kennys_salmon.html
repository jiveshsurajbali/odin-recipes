    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul><li>2 fresh salmon fillets</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 cup of mature cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of mascarpone cheese</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of butter</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of plain flour</li>
      <li>280ml of single cream</li>
      <li>A squeeze of lemon juice for taste</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>A handful of fresh parsley</li>
      <li>Gem lettuce for garnish</li></ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>  
    <ol><li>Preheat your oven to 200 degrees. While it's heating up, 
        make sure the salmon is skinned and boneless.</li>
      <li>Place a large pan on a medium heat and add the butter and 
        flour. Combine them till you get a pale-yellow paste.</li>
      <li>Continue to constantly stir your mixture while adding your 
        single cream and a sprinkling of salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Next, finely chop your garlic cloves and add them in as the 
        sauce begins to bubble. Continue stirring and add in your 
        mascarpone cheese.</li>
      <li>Once everything is combined, add in your ricotta, and mature 
        cheddar cheese and continue to stir. When all the cheese has 
        melted together, you should have a delicious cheesy sauce that 
        is lovely and thick.</li>
      <li>Now, place your salmon fillets into the baking dish and cover 
        with the sauce, adding any extra cheese on top if desired.</li>
      <li>Bake in the oven for 40 minutes and garnish with gem lettuce 
        for a tasty recreation of Kenny's salmon with all the in-game 
        buffs.</li></ol>
