      <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>2 fresh salmon fillets</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 cup of mature cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of plain flour</li>
        <li>280ml of single cream</li>
        <li>A squeeze of lemon juice for taste</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Gem lettuce for garnish</li></ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200 degrees. While it's heating up, 
          make sure the salmon is skinned and boneless.</li>
        <li>Place a large pan on a medium heat and add the butter and 
          flour. Combine them till you get a pale-yellow paste.</li>
        <li>Continue to constantly stir your mixture while adding your 
          single cream and a sprinkling of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Next, finely chop your garlic cloves and add them in as the 
          sauce begins to bubble. Continue stirring and add in your 
          mascarpone cheese.</li>
        <li>Once everything is combined, add in your ricotta, and mature 
          cheddar cheese and continue to stir. When all the cheese has 
          melted together, you should have a delicious cheesy sauce that 
          is lovely and thick.</li>
        <li>Now, place your salmon fillets into the baking dish and cover 
          with the sauce, adding any extra cheese on top if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 40 minutes and garnish with gem lettuce 
          for a tasty recreation of Kenny's salmon with all the in-game 
          buffs.</li></ol>
