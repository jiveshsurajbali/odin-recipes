# odin-recipes

This is my first TOP project. I built a basic website, with a homepage that links to three separate web pages. The website, was built using only HTML. The content of the website is three recipes lifted from video games I enjoy. The website was made to practice using headings, lists, paragraphs, links and images in HTML.
